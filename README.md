This repository is for the course project of CS 532: Matrix Methods in Machine Learning.

Please refer to /doc for project updates.

/src has two notebooks: 
1. data.ipynb: Extracts features from the data and get data in desired form which can be used to run different algorithms
2. models.ipynb: Implements KNN, SVM, Neural Network and Random Forest

The goal of this project is to  predict the match outcome using the historic features . In particular, we plan to consider the recent performance of the home and away teams in last few games at home and away venues against other teams in the league. We also consider the history of encounter of the playing teams against each other.
